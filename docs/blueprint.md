## Style Guidelines:

- Use a primary palette of blues to convey calmness, trust, and technology, ranging from dark/deep blues for backgrounds to medium/bright blues for interactive elements.
- Incorporate a lighter blue or sky blue for secondary accents, selected states, or card backgrounds to subtly highlight elements.
- Use white or very light grey for text and contrasting elements over blue backgrounds to ensure legibility.
- Use teal (#008080) as an accent color, especially for voice-related actions like recording or indicating when a user is speaking, ensuring it stands out but remains consistent with the calming blue theme.
- Maintain a minimalist, modern, and clean aesthetic to keep focus on the audio content and personality information.
- Ensure all interface elements avoid visual clutter and saturation to highlight auditory content and personality information, adopting an accessible typography for ease of reading.
- Emphasize a user-friendly interface with an intuitive bottom navigation bar (TabBar) that could include Home/Dashboard, Ecosystem Discovery, Direct Messages, and Profile for easy access to core features.
- Implement subtle animations to indicate active voice input or output.
